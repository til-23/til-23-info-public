Competition Structure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Competition Format
##################

Novice and Advanced tier will compete *separately* from each other, i.e. Novice-tier participants compete against Novice-tier,
Advanced-tier participants complete against Advanced-tier participants.

In each competition tier, teams will be randomly split into 2 groups (A and B) to participate in the 
**round-robin group stage**.

During the group stage, each team will play a match against every other team in its group. Winning a 
match yields 3 match points, drawing yields 1 match point, and losing yields 0 match points.

Match points will be tallied and the **highest ranked team** for each group will proceed to the grand 
final, where they will compete for the overall 1st place. The **second highest ranked team** for each group 
will compete for the overall 3rd place.

Participants will be ranked (and tie-broken) in this priority order:

1. total match points (higher better)
2. total maze score (higher better)
3. total maze timing (lower better) 
4. if there is still a tie, the tie will be broken with the teams' ranking in the qualifiers stage.

Winning a Match
---------------

To win a match, your team must have a higher maze score than the current match's opponent. 
If the maze score is tied, then the shorter maze timing wins. Else it's a draw.
