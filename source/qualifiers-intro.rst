Note About Submission
#####################

**Do note the different datasets given, when and what to submit**

Note that from 19 May 2023 1200H, to 31 May 2023 1159H, you will be tasked to train your models using the **train set**. Then, perform inference on the **test set** and submit your results to the Zindi platform. **The evaluation criteria for qualifying to the finals will be based on the test set.** 


General Rules
#############

Flouting any of these rules results in disqualification.

- To qualify for the finals, your code must be able to run on the provided online development environment, so as to ensure fairness.
- Do not plagiarise code from other teams
- Do not share your models with other teams
- No manual annotating of labels for the test set is allowed 
- No purchasing of datasets
- You are **NOT ALLOWED to call external APIs** such as Amazon Rekognition to do computer vision tasks, or such as IBM Watson, AWS speech-to-text or any other paid transcribing services to do the transcribing.
- You are **NOT ALLOWED** to purchase AI models. Rule of thumb is, you should not be purchasing any data, models, or subscriptions for this competition.
- You are *allowed* to source for additional dataset on top of what is given in TIL2023 with the given conditions:
	- Participants **MUST** cite where the additional source of dataset(s) and model(s) came from (cite the webpage) and how it is being downloaded (the specific download pages).
	- The additional datasets that the participants included **HAS TO BE OPEN SOURCE**, i.e free and accessible by everyone on the web and **CANNOT** be a paid dataset.
	- Free datasets that belong to academic institutions BUT requires the disclosure of one’s university email to access are **ALLOWED, BUT participants are required to read the dataset’s User Acceptance Policy carefully and if the participants violate the rules,** TIL2023 holds no responsibilities for the consequences.
