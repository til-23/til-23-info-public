Robotics  
########
Each team will be able to test their robotics code in a physical arena on a physical robot during the 
familiarisation period from 8 Jun 2023 - 16 Jun 2023. There will be an online Zoom session held on 
**7 Jun 2023 10am-1pm**
to introduce the finals challenges, present a demo of the robotics and Q&A.

Webinar link for the demo will be shared later.

To ensure equal opportunity to interact with the robots, teams can book 1 *slot* in *each* of the following sessions.

- Session 1: 8th June - 9th June (**Mandatory**)
- Session 2: 12th June - 13th June

Things to Note
--------------
* Slots will be granted on a first-come, first-serve basis. 
* Failure to sign up means you will be randomly allocated a slot.
* The maze configurations in the pre-final testing venue *will not* be the same as the final.

Voice Recording
###############

Each participant in each team must record 5 audio clips. These will be anonymized and used for the Speaker Identification and ASR challenge in the finals.
Note that all members MUST be present for Session 1 in their allocated slot so as to record the required audio clips.

In the event that some members are unable to make it down during Session 1, they will be required to complete the recording by Session 2. The dataset will be released on Sunday, 11 June 12pm, after Session 1 for teams to start developing and training models. However, do note that it might be the incomplete dataset as some members have not done the recording. The complete dataset will be disseminated at a later date when all participants completed the recording process.

Audio for Speaker ID
--------------------

Three short passages will be provided to record three 15-second clips. The passages require at 
least 20 seconds to read, after which the clips will be trimmed to 15 seconds. There are no 
concerns regarding where the passage ends in the clip since features are extracted from the 
voice frequency, not the exact words.

.. note::
    * For Novice tier, no background noises will be added.
    * For Advanced tier participants, background noises will be added to clips.

Audio for Decoding Digits
-------------------------

10 sentences containing containing the digits 0-9 will be provided. Each team member will record 2 
clips, each containing 1 unique digit. No white noise will be added to these clips.


Things to Note
--------------

- For **Speaker ID**, re-recording is not allowed. You are encouraged to maintain the tone 
  and pitch while reading the 3 passages. If you read the passage wrongly (e.g., skip a 
  word, wrong pronunciation), it has minimal implication since this challenge is not text-dependent.
- For **Digit Detection**, the participant can listen to the audio to verify if the digit is audible. 
  The participant is allowed to re-record once if the recording is not satisfactory. After that, you 
  need to choose between the 2 recordings.
