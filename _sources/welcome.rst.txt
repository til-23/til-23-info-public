Welcome
~~~~~~~

Welcome to DSTA's highly anticipated BrainHack TIL 2023!

You are tasked with the security management of a high level conference between foreign delegates held at “Crown Renaissance Resort”. 
You have received reports that a terrorist organisation is planning to kidnap Mr. Dastan, the President of United AI, who chairs the conference. 
The intelligence team has also managed to retrieve pictures of the kidnapper, also known as “White Stinger”.

Your task is to prepare for a search-and-rescue mission in the event that Mr. Dastan is kidnapped. To achieve this, two models are needed:

- Computer vision models that are able to detect and identify (1) Mr. Dastan, and (2) White Stinger. 
- Automatic speech recognition model to interpret your intelligence teams communications about the whereabouts of Mr. Dastan

We are thrilled to have you join us in this exciting event, where you will be able to learn from and compete against like-minded individuals in the field. 
Best of luck to all participants, and may the best AI win!
